Full Stack Conf Registration project for Treehouse Full Stack JavaScript Tech Degree

The Full Stack Conf Registration project is a project that explores the use of only vanilla javascript (ES6). It is a registration page that handles all user interactions by manipulating the DOM with javascript.

As a current software engineer, this was a fun challenge because often, we rely on libraries, frameworks, etc to get a job like this done. This was an excellent practice of javascript!
